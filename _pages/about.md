<div class="about-intro" markdown="1">
I am currently a master's student in Big Data Engineering at <mark><a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Tsinghua University</u></strong></a></mark>, advised by <mark><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4gH3sxsAAAAJ" target="_blank"><strong><u>Prof. Yujiu Yang</u></strong></a></mark>, and a research intern at <mark><a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</u></strong></a></mark> in Shanghai. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from <mark><a href="https://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Hunan University</u></strong></a></mark>.

My research focuses on the safety, alignment, and interpretability of large (multimodal) language models. I have worked on topics such as MLLMs Safety Evaluation, LLM Unlearning, and LLM Watermarking.

My long-term vision is to solve real problems through research that is minimal in design, grounded in theory, and genuinely useful in practice.
